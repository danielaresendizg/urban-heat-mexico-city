**Title:** Coupling Remote Sensing, Morphology, and Microclimate Simulation to Analyse Urban Heat in Mexico City

**Abstract:**
This paper examines how extreme heat compounds existing social inequalities in Mexico City and develops an operational pathway for delivering cooling where it yields the greatest social benefit. We integrate a decade of summer satellite observations with block-level census indicators to estimate daytime air temperature across the entire city. Results indicate systematic exposure disparities: older adults, disabled residents and households without a car are disproportionately located in hotter blocks, commonly experiencing daytime conditions around 2 to 3°C above the citywide mean.

Moving beyond surface mapping, we test whether thermal exposure aligns with the city's everyday movement structure. By combining street-network configuration (Space Syntax) with built-form descriptors (Space Matrix), we show that high-exposure areas also contain highly connected, heavily traversed corridors.

**Key contribution:** A screening workflow that translates evidence into implementable targets by jointly considering demographic vulnerability, local temperature variation and network centrality to identify priority corridors where interventions protect the most exposed groups and largest numbers of pedestrians.
